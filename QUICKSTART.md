# Quick Start Guide

## Installation

```bash
# Install the skill via the And/or Labs marketplace
/andor install positioning
```

That's it! The "Positioning" skill is now ready to use in your Claude Code environment.

## Your First Diagnostic

In a Claude Code session, type:

```
/diagnose https://yourcompany.com
```

This tells you immediately:
- ✓ or ✗ Can visitors understand what you do?
- ✓ or ✗ Can they tell who it's for?
- ✓ or ✗ Can they see why to choose you?
- MECLABS score (/20).
- Top 3 red flags.

## All 6 Commands

| Command | Use Case |
|---------|----------|
| `/diagnose <url>` | Quick 5-second test + MECLABS score |
| `/audit <url>` | Comprehensive 100-point diagnostic |
| `/alignment` | Test team agreement on positioning |
| `/antipatterns <url>` | Scan for specific positioning mistakes |
| `/compare <url1> <url2>` | Side-by-side competitive comparison |
| `/export <url>` | Generate shareable markdown report |

## What You Get

- Specific scores (not just "needs work").
- Evidence-based findings (quotes from your homepage).
- Framework violations (which traps you've fallen into).
- Predicted symptoms (business pain this causes).
- Prioritized fixes (what to tackle first).

## What You DON'T Get

- Rewritten homepage copy.
- Positioning statements written for you.
- Decisions made for you.

This is a diagnostic tool. It tells you what's broken and why. You fix it.

## Recommended Workflow

```
/diagnose <url>       # Quick read: is there a problem?
/audit <url>          # Deep analysis: what exactly and why?
/alignment            # Internal check: does the team agree?
/antipatterns <url>   # Language scan: where are the bad habits?
/compare <url> <url>  # Competitive analysis: how do you stack up?
/export <url>         # Package it all for stakeholders.
```
